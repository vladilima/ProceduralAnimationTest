A showcase of some procedural animation techniques done from scratch, showing some fishes, snake-like creatures and lizards with Inverse Kinematics legs.

## 🐍 Snake

The snake is a simple creature made up of a line of dots that each follow the next one in the chain, constraining the distance to a set segment length, creating this snake-like body.

Its body shape can also be easily changed for interesting results.

> I like the little short one.

## 🐟 Fish

The fish has a similar body to the snake, but its lateral fins rotate ahead of the body segment it's attached to, giving it an illusion of guiding the movement of the body. The dorsal and caudal fins are also features that contribute to selling the fish-like movements.

> Watching this is honestly entrancing as hell.

## 🦎 Lizard

The lizard has 4 Inverse Kinematics limbs attached to its body, giving the illusion that it is walking along the screen with its little paws.

> The paws are lowkey cute though

Here is a showcase of the Inverse Kinematics limb working on its own, and how it can be customized.
